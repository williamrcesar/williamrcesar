# Hi, I'm William 👋

I work mainly with **Ruby on Rails** and **n8n**, building **SaaS products, automations, and API-driven systems** used in real production environments.

My focus is on **reliable software**, clean architecture, automated testing, and scalable infrastructure.

## 🚀 Ruby on Rails

### 🧱 SaaS Boilerplate (in development)
**Repository:** `rails-saas-boilerplate`

A production-oriented Ruby on Rails boilerplate used as the foundation for a real SaaS product  
(**https://priorizzi.ai/**).

**Key concepts and features:**
- Multi-tenant SaaS structure
- User roles and access restrictions
- Subscription and billing logic with **Stripe**
- Background jobs with **Sidekiq**
- Caching and queues with **Redis**
- Production-ready architecture patterns

> ⚠️ This repository is under active development and represents an extracted and evolving
> part of the architecture used in a live SaaS application.

---

### 🧪 Automated Testing (Rails)
**Repository:** `rails-automated-tests-barbershop`

A Ruby on Rails application focused on **automated testing practices**, based on a real
barbershop / hair salon system.

**Highlights:**
- RSpec setup and structure
- Model, service, and request specs
- Test data with factories
- Real-world business rules covered by tests

---

## 🤖 n8n & Automations

I design and operate complex automations using **n8n**, integrating multiple systems and APIs
to replace manual processes and scale operations.

**Examples of integrations:**
- WhatsApp APIs (Evolution, Wati)
- Payment systems (Pix, credit card)
- CRMs and ERPs
- Google Sheets, Drive, Calendar
- Facebook Ads, Notion, Tally, Trello
- AI providers (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek)
- Webhooks and custom APIs

These automations handle **high-volume messaging**, lead qualification, document processing,
billing workflows, and AI-powered customer interactions.

## ⚙️ DevOps & Infrastructure

Hands-on experience operating and maintaining production environments, with a focus on
**practical infrastructure setup, automation, and reliability**.

**Containerization & Orchestration**
- Docker for application containerization
- Kubernetes (basic usage for deployment and service management)

**Cloud & Servers**
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI):
  - VPS creation and management
  - Automated deployments via Git and SSH
- AWS:
  - VPS-based deployments (EC2-style usage)
  - Environment setup for Rails and automation services

**Networking & Security**
- Cloudflare:
  - DNS configuration
  - Domain management
  - Storage and basic security features

**Operations**
- Background job infrastructure (Sidekiq + Redis)
- Self-hosted n8n environments
- Webhook reliability, retries, and fallback strategies
- CI/CD and versioned deployments
