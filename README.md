# Hi, I'm William 👋

I'm a Software Engineer who builds **SaaS products, complex automations, and API-driven systems** used in real production environments. 

My core focus is on **reliable software**, clean architecture, automated testing, and scalable infrastructure. I design systems with an emphasis on stability, seamless integration, and long-term maintainability.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Redis, Sidekiq, APIs (REST/Webhooks)
- **Automations & AI:** n8n, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Coolify, AWS, Oracle Cloud, Cloudflare, CI/CD
- **Integrations:** Stripe, WhatsApp (Evolution, Wati), CRMs, Google Workspace

## 🚀 Ruby on Rails Projects

### 🧱 SaaS Boilerplate (In Development)
**Repository:** `rails-saas-boilerplate` | **Live App:**(https://priorizzi.ai/)

A production-oriented Ruby on Rails boilerplate used as the foundation for a real AI-powered SaaS product. It represents an extracted and evolving part of the architecture used in a live application.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-tenant SaaS structure with strict user roles and access restrictions
- Subscription and billing logic powered by **Stripe**
- Background processing with **Sidekiq + Redis**
- Performance optimization and production-ready architecture patterns

### 🧪 Automated Testing Playground
**Repository:** `rails-automated-tests-barbershop`

A Ruby on Rails application focused heavily on **automated testing practices**, based on a real-world barbershop/hair salon business logic.

**Highlights:**
- Comprehensive **RSpec** setup and structure
- Coverage across Models, Services, and Requests
- Test data generation with Factories
- Real-world business rules secured by automated tests

## 🤖 n8n, AI & Complex Automations

I design and operate resilient automations using **n8n** (self-hosted), integrating multiple systems to replace manual processes, scale operations, and build AI agents. These automations are built with retry mechanisms, fallbacks, and monitoring.

**What I build with n8n:**
- **AI-Powered Agents:** For sales, customer support, and scheduling (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek).
- **High-Volume Messaging:** WhatsApp automations via Evolution API and Wati.
- **Business Workflows:** CRM/Lead management pipelines, document processing, and billing workflows.
- **Ecosystem Integrations:** Payment gateways (Pix, Credit Card), Google Workspace, Facebook Ads, Notion, Trello, and custom APIs.

## ⚙️ DevOps & Infrastructure

I don't just write code; I deploy and maintain it. I have solid experience operating production environments, ensuring high availability and secure deployments.

- **Server Management:** VPS-based deployments on **Oracle Cloud** and **AWS**.
- **Containerization:** Dockerized applications and services.
- **Self-Hosting:** Managing production-grade **n8n** setups using **Coolify**.
- **Networking & Storage:** **Cloudflare** DNS configuration and storage management.
- **Reliability:** Redis-backed queue systems, background job monitoring, and CI/CD versioned deployments.
